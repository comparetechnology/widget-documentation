# Compare Technology Widget Implementation

The implementation of the Compare Technology comparison widget is nothing more than a simple copy and paste of two lines of code that’s made available to you from with your account dashboard. The first part is a line of HTML that’s used as a target for where you want the comparison widget to appear on your target webpage(s) and the second part is a line of JavaScript which, when executed, injects Compare Technology’s comparison iFrame into the target HTML.

## Sample code

**HTML**
```
<div class="comparetechnology-widget-uk" data-id="[YOUR_UNIQUE_ID]"></div>
```

**Javascript**
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://assets.comparetechnology.co.uk/widget.js" async></script>
```
